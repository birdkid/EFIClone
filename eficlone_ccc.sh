# This script is designed to be run automatically by CCC.
# This script can be invoked as "post-flight" script at the end of a clone
# task. It will copy the contents of the source drive's EFI partition to the
# destination drive's EFI partition. It will COMPLETELY DELETE and replace all
# data on the destination EFI partition.

# THIS SCRIPT MODIFIES DATA AND AS SUCH CAN CAUSE DATA LOSS!
# Use this at your own risk.
# We've tried to make it as safe as possible, but nobody's perfect.

# Strict mode.
